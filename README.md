#👋 Hi, I'm Minh Nhat Nguyen  
###Automation Engineering Student | Automation & Control Systems Enthusiast

✨ Hi, I’m currently studying Automation Engineering with a strong interest in automation systems, control logic, and system-level engineering.  
My focus is on understanding how industrial and cyber-physical systems are designed, tested, and verified, with a growing interest in automation beyond factory environments, such as R&D, robotics, and platform-level automation.

Driven by curiosity and a hands-on mindset, I enjoy working with real systems — from PLC-controlled stations to workflow and test automation — and learning how complex systems behave under real constraints.

🎓 Learning through:
- Academic automation projects  
- Hands-on control and testing tasks  
- Practical internships and experimentation  

🚀 I see automation not only as programming, but as a way to structure, verify, and improve system behavior.

📁 Take a look at my repositories to see academic projects, automation logic, and experiments related to control and system integration.
